1. Introduction
---------------

The CRE2 distribution is a C language wrapper for the RE2 library, which
is implemented in C++.  RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative
to  backtracking regular  expression engines  like those  used in  PCRE,
Perl, and Python.

  This distribution makes  use of the GNU Autotools.  The  last time the
maintainer updated  this paragraph,  he had tested  this package  with a
checkout of re2 on Mon Feb 15, 2016.

3. Install
----------

To install RE2 follow the instructions  in the README file in RE2's.  To
install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd cre2-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/cre2

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/cre2

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  Github
site): we  must install the  GNU Autotools (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,
GNU Libtool),  then we must first  run the script "autogen.sh"  from the
top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd cre2
    $ sh autogen.sh

notice  that  "autogen.sh"  will   run  the  programs  "autoreconf"  and
"libtoolize"; the  latter is  selected through the  environment variable
"LIBTOOLIZE",  whose  value  can  be  customised;  for  example  to  run
"glibtoolize" rather than "libtoolize" we do:

   $ LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install
