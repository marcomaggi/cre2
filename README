1. Introduction
---------------

The CRE2 distribution is a C language wrapper for the RE2 library, which
is implemented in C++.  RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative
to  backtracking regular  expression engines  like those  used in  PCRE,
Perl, and Python.

  This  distribution  makes use  of  the  GNU  Autotools; it  relies  on
pkg-config  to  find the  installed  re2  library.   The last  time  the
maintainer updated  this paragraph,  he had tested  this package  with a
release of RE2 2024-07-02.

3. Install
----------

To install RE2 follow the instructions  in the README file in RE2's.  To
install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd cre2-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/cre2

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/cre2

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  Github
site): we  must install the  GNU Autotools (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,
GNU Libtool),  then we must first  run the script "autogen.sh"  from the
top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd cre2
    $ sh autogen.sh

notice  that  "autogen.sh"  will   run  the  programs  "autoreconf"  and
"libtoolize"; the  latter is  selected through the  environment variable
"LIBTOOLIZE",  whose  value  can  be  customised;  for  example  to  run
"glibtoolize" rather than "libtoolize" we do:

   $ LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

A. Credits
----------

RE2 is  a Google project.  CRE2  is based on code  by Keegan McAllister.
This distribution was assembled by Marco Maggi.

  Matthew  Hall (https://github.com/megahall)  contributed miscellaneous
fixes.

  Maksym  Melnychok (https://github.com/keymone)  contributed a  fix for
wrong usage of variable-length arrays.

  afiaux    (https://github.com/afiaux)   contributed    the   RE2:Set()
interface.

  Guillaume Massé (https://github.com/MasseGuillaume) contributed fixes
and the implementation of "cre2_find_named_capturing_groups()".

  Will    Speak    (https://github.com/iwillspeak)    contributed    the
implementation of the named capturing --> groups iterator.

D. Installing re2 and its dependencies
--------------------------------------

This may be a challenge, depending on how much of a cmake connoisseur we
are.

  In general,  we have to remember  that: if we install  both the shared
and  the  static libraries:  when  compiling  with common  command  line
options, the  static libraries  will take  precedence.  This  package is
meant to  be used with  shared libraries, but  it should work  fine with
static libraries, too.

  Let's suppose we want to install  all the packages under the directory
"/opt/re2/2024-07-02"; on  a Unix system,  we will  need to put  in some
profile configuration file something like:

    RE2_PREFIX=/opt/re2/2024-07-02
    RE2_LIBDIR=${RE2_PREFIX}/lib64
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${RE2_LIBDIR}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${RE2_LIBDIR}/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

as a first attempt: no other search path should be upgraded, let's leave
to the packages to find include files and everything else.

  When  configuring, building  and installing  the prerequisite  package
"abseil" we should follow the instructions  in its README file; but here
is a hint to configure the package to build shared libraries:

    $ cmake .						\
	--install-prefix "$RE2_PREFIX"			\
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo		\
	-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-fPIC"		\
	-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17				\
	-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON				\
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release			\
	-DABSL_PROPAGATE_CXX_STD=ON

  When  configuring, building  and installing  the prerequisite  package
"googletest" we should  follow the instructions in its  README file; but
here is a hint to configure the package to build shared libraries:

    $ cmake .						\
        --install-prefix "$RE2_PREFIX"			\
        -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON				\
        -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-fPIC"

  When configuring, building and installing  the package "re2" itself we
should follow the instructions in its README file; but here is a hint to
configure the package to build shared libraries:

    $ cmake .						\
	--install-prefix "$RE2_PREFIX"			\
	-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON				\
	-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-fPIC"		\
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
