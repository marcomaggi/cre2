# cre2

## Introduction

The CRE2 distribution is a C language wrapper for the RE2 library, which
is implemented in C++.  RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative
to  backtracking regular  expression engines  like those  used in  PCRE,
Perl, and Python.

  This  distribution  makes use  of  the  GNU  Autotools; it  relies  on
`pkg-config`  to  find the  installed  re2  library  The last  time  the
maintainer updated  this paragraph,  he had tested  this package  with a
checkout of re2 on Apr 11, 2017.

## Install

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

```
$ cd cre2-0.1.0
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make
$ make check
$ make install
```

to inspect the available configuration options:

```
$ ../configure --help
```

The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

```
$ make -j4 all && make -j4 check
```

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

The Makefile supports the DESTDIR  environment variable to install files
in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

```
$ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/cre2
```

to really do it:

```
$ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/cre2
```

After the  installation it is  possible to verify the  installed library
against the test suite with:

```
$ make installcheck
```

From a repository checkout or snapshot  (the ones from the Github site):
we  must install  the GNU  Autotools  (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,  GNU
Libtool), then  we must first run  the script "autogen.sh" from  the top
source directory, to generate the needed files:

```
$ cd cre2
$ sh autogen.sh

```

notice  that  `autogen.sh`  will   run  the  programs  `autoreconf`  and
`libtoolize`; the  latter is  selected through the  environment variable
`LIBTOOLIZE`,  whose  value  can  be  customised;  for  example  to  run
`glibtoolize` rather than `libtoolize` we do:

```
$ LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize sh autogen.sh
```

After this  the procedure  is the same  as the one  for building  from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

```
$ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
$ make
$ make check
$ make install
```

## Usage

Read the documentation.

## Installing re2 and its dependencies

This may be a challenge, depending on how much of a cmake connoisseur we
are.

In general, we have to remember that:  if we install both the shared and
the static libraries:  when compiling with common  command line options,
the static libraries will take precedence.   This package is meant to be
used  with  shared  libraries,  but  it should  work  fine  with  static
libraries, too.

Let's suppose  we want to install  all the packages under  the directory
"/opt/re2/2024-07-02"; on  a Unix system,  we will  need to put  in some
profile configuration file something like:

```
RE2_PREFIX=/opt/re2/2024-07-02
RE2_LIBDIR=${RE2_PREFIX}/lib64
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${RE2_LIBDIR}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${RE2_LIBDIR}/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
```

as a first attempt: no other search path should be upgraded, let's leave
to the packages to find include files and everything else.

When  configuring,  building  and installing  the  prerequisite  package
`abseil` we should follow the instructions  in its README file; but here
is a hint to configure the package to build shared libraries:

```
$ cmake .  \
    --install-prefix "$RE2_PREFIX"      \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo   \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-fPIC"    \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17             \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON              \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release          \
    -DABSL_PROPAGATE_CXX_STD=ON
```

When  configuring,  building  and installing  the  prerequisite  package
`googletest` we should  follow the instructions in its  README file; but
here is a hint to configure the package to build shared libraries:

```
$ cmake .  \
    --install-prefix "$RE2_PREFIX"      \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON              \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-fPIC"
```

  When configuring, building and installing  the package `re2` itself we
should follow the instructions in its README file; but here is a hint to
configure the package to build shared libraries:

```
$ cmake .  \
    --install-prefix "$RE2_PREFIX"      \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON              \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-fPIC"    \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
